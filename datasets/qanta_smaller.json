Spatial hole burning in continuous wave lasers can be avoided by placing two of these devices on either side of the gain medium, a process called a \"twisted-mode technique.\" An alternative to one type of these devices is the Fresnel rhomb. The amount of retardation is a multiple of two pi larger in a \"multiple-order\" one of these devices than in a \"zero-order\" one of these devices. In one type of these devices, the waves propagating parallel to the \"fast axis\" acquire a phase shift of pi over 2 with respect to waves propagating parallel to the \"slow axis,\" because the index of refraction is split into \"ordinary\" and \"extraordinary\" components.
