On Valentine's Day in 1982, a possible but unconfirmed signal of one was recorded by Blas Cabrera. JJ Thomson showed that a static configuration of one separated from an electric charge by some distance has a classical angular momentum along the line between them. Restricting this angular momentum to be a multiple of one-half h-bar leads to the Dirac quantization condition, which is one way to understand why they famously could explain the quantization of electric charge. Another explanation involves Dirac strings. For 10 points, name this theoretical object that produces a B field similar to the E field produced by a point charge.\",\n",
