A paper titled for this concept uses three-value logic to create \"fixed-point semantics\". A 1933 paper defines this property as holding for X if and only if X appears in a metalanguage. Bertrand Russell used the sentence \"Bishop Stubbs was hanged for murder\" to attack a definition of this as \"coherence\". Late in life, Heidegger rejected his own definition of this property as \"disclosedness\" or \"aletheia\". Kripke wrote an \"Outline to a Theory of\" this property, of which Tarski introduced a \"semantic conception\". The problem of self-reference and this property is called the \"liar\\'s paradox\". For 10 points, \"correspondence theory\" defines what property as \"agreement with reality or fact\"?',\n",

These cells store their ribosomes inside a network of cross-linked filaments known as cytoplasmic lattices. mRNAs remain untranslated in these cells during their prolonged dictyate (\"DICK-tee-ate\") resting phase. Inside these cells, phospholipase C-zeta triggers oscillations of calcium that mediates the release of cortical granules into the surrounding perivitelline (\"PAIR-ee-VIT-uh-leen\") space. These cells are protected by a layer of cumulus cells, which themselves surround the zona pellucida. A polar body is generated during each round of division of these cells, the first of which stops at prophase I before birth. Once the follicle ruptures, these cells travel through the Fallopian tube.
