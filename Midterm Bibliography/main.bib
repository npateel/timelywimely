We propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human evaluation, and that has little marginal cost per run. We present this method as an automated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.},

abstract = {Answering complex questions is one of the challenges that question-answering (QA)
systems face today. While complexity has several facets, question dimensions like
temporal and spatial intents necessitate specialized treatment. Methods geared towards
such questions need benchmarks that reflect the desired aspects and challenges. Here,
we take a key step in this direction, and release a new benchmark, TempQuestions,
containing 1,271 questions, that are all temporal in nature, paired with their answers.
As a key contribution that enabled the creation of this resource, we provide a crisp
definition for temporal questions. Most questions require decomposing them into sub-questions,
and the questions are of a kind that they would be best evaluated on a combination
of structured data and unstructured text sources. Experiments with two QA systems
demonstrate the need for further research on complex questions.},

abstract = {In this paper, a method of event ordering based on temporal information resolution is presented. This method consists of two main steps: on the one hand, the recognition and resolution of the temporal expressions that can be transformed on a date, and therefore these dates establish an order between the events that contain them. On the other hand, the detection of temporal signals, for example after, that can not be transformed on a concrete date but relate two events in a chronological way. This event ordering method can be applied to Natural Language Processing systems, for example: Summarization, Question Answering, etc. It is important to emphasize that the event ordering method is based on a multilingual temporal information resolution system. Moreover, this multilinguality has been automatically obtained from a monolingual system (Spanish). The evaluation of the multilingual system is also shown in this paper, achieving a precision of 88% for Spanish and 77% for English.}

abstract="Long-term news article archives are valuable resources about our past, allowing people to know detailed information of events that occurred at specific time points. To make better use of such heritage collections, this work considers the task of large scale question answering on long-term news article archives. Questions on such archives are often event-related. In addition, they usually exhibit strong temporal aspects and can be roughly categorized into two types: (1) ones containing explicit temporal expressions, and (2) ones only implicitly associated with particular time periods. We focus on the latter type as such questions are more difficult to be answered, and we propose a retriever-reader model with an additional module for reranking articles by exploiting temporal information from different angles. Experimental results on carefully constructed test set show that our model outperforms the existing question answering systems, thanks to an additional module that finds more relevant documents.",
