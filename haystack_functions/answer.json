He is best known for his theory of relativity and specifically mass-energy equivalence, formula_1. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\"\nEinstein's many contributions to physics include his special theory of relativity, which reconciled mechanics with electromagnetism, and his general theory of relativity, which extended the principle of relativity to non-uniform motion, creating a new theory of gravitation. His other contributions include relativistic cosmology, capillary action, critical opalescence, classical problems of statistical mechanics and their application to quantum theory, an explanation of the Brownian movement of molecules, atomic transition probabilities, the quantum theory of a monatomic gas, thermal properties of light with low radiation density (which laid the foundation for the photon theory), a theory of radiation including stimulated emission, the conception of a unified field theory, and the geometrization of physics.\nWorks by Albert Einstein include more than fifty scientific papers and also non-scientific books. In 1999 Einstein was named \"Time\" magazine's \"Person of the Century\", and a poll of prominent physicists named him the greatest physicist of all time. In popular culture the name \"Einstein\" has become synonymous with genius.\nYouth and schooling.\nAlbert Einstein was born into a Jewish family in Ulm, W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany on March 14, 1879. His father was Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer. His mother was Pauline Einstein (n\u00e9e Koch). In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where his father and his uncle founded a company, Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein &amp; Cie that manufactured electrical equipment, providing the first lighting for the Oktoberfest and cabling for the Munich suburb of Schwabing. \nThe Einsteins were not observant of Jewish religious practices, and Albert attended a Catholic elementary school. Although Albert had early speech difficulties, he was a top student in elementary school. \nWhen Albert was five, his father showed him a pocket compass. Albert realized that something in empty space was moving the needle and later stated that this experience made \"a deep and lasting impression\". At his mother's insistence, he took violin lessons starting at age six, and although he disliked them and eventually quit, he later took great pleasure in Mozart's violin sonatas. As he grew, Albert built models and mechanical devices for fun, and began to show a talent for mathematics. \nIn 1889, family friend Max Talmud (later: Talmey), a medical student, introduced the ten-year-old Albert to key science, mathematics, and philosophy texts, including Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\" and Euclid's \"Elements\" (Einstein called it the \"holy little geometry book\"). From Euclid, Albert began to understand deductive reasoning (integral to theoretical physics), and by the age of twelve, he learned Euclidean geometry from a school booklet. Soon thereafter he began to investigate calculus.\nIn his early teens, Albert attended the new and progressive Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Albert clashed with authorities and resented the school regimen. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in strict rote learning. \nIn 1894, when Einstein was fifteen, his father's business failed, and the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and then, after a few months, to Pavia. During this time, Albert wrote his first scientific work, \"The Investigation of the State of Aether in Magnetic Fields\".\nAlbert had been left behind in Munich to finish high school, but in the spring of 1895, he withdrew to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.\nRather than completing high school, Albert decided to apply directly to the ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland. Without a school certificate, he was required to take an entrance examination, which he did not pass, although he got exceptional marks in mathematics and physics. Einstein wrote that it was in that same year, at age 16, that he first performed his famous thought experiment, visualizing traveling alongside a beam of light .\nThe Einsteins sent Albert to Aarau, Switzerland to finish secondary school. While lodging with the family of Professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with the family's daughter, Sofia Marie-Jeanne Amanda Winteler, called \"Marie\". (Albert's sister, Maja, his confidant, later married Paul Winteler.) In Aarau, Albert studied Maxwell's electromagnetic theory. In 1896, he graduated at age 17, renounced his German citizenship to avoid military service (with his father's approval), and finally enrolled in the mathematics program at ETH. On February 21, 1901, he gained Swiss citizenship, which he never revoked. Marie moved to Olsberg, Switzerland for a teaching post.\nIn 1896, Einstein's future wife, Mileva Mari\u0107, also enrolled at ETH, as the only woman studying mathematics. During the next few years, Einstein and Mari\u0107's friendship developed into romance. Einstein's mother objected because she thought Mari\u0107 \"too old\", not Jewish, and \"physically defective\". Einstein and Mari\u0107 had a daughter, Lieserl Einstein, born in early 1902. Her fate is unknown.\nEinstein graduated in 1900 from ETH with a degree in physics. That same year, Einstein's friend Michele Besso introduced him to the work of Ernst Mach. The next year, Einstein published a paper in the prestigious \"Annalen der Physik\" on the capillary forces of a straw .\nPatent office.\nFollowing graduation, Einstein could not find a teaching post. After almost two years of searching, a former classmate's father helped him get a job in Bern, at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office, as an assistant examiner. His responsibility was evaluating patent applications for electromagnetic devices. In 1903, Einstein's position at the Swiss Patent Office was made permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he \"fully mastered machine technology\".\nEinstein's college friend, Michele Besso, also worked at the patent office. With friends they met in Bern, they formed a weekly discussion club on science and philosophy, jokingly named \"The Olympia Academy\". Their readings included Poincar\u00e9, Mach and Hume, who influenced Einstein's scientific and philosophical outlook.\nWhile this period at the patent office has often been cited as a waste of Einstein's talents, or as a temporary job with no connection to his interests in physics, the historian of science Peter Galison has argued that Einstein's work there was connected to his later interests. Much of that work related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time: two technical problems of the day that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.\nEinstein married Mileva Mari\u0107 on January 6, 1903, and their relationship was, for a time, a personal and intellectual partnership. In a letter to her, Einstein wrote of Mileva as \"a creature who is my equal and who is as strong and independent as I am.\" There has been debate about whether Mari\u0107 influenced Einstein's work; most historians do not think she made major contributions, however. On May 14, 1904, Albert and Mileva's first son, Hans Albert Einstein, was born. Their second son, Eduard Einstein, was born on July 28, 1910.\n\"Annus Mirabilis\".\nIn 1905, while he was working in the patent office, Einstein had four papers published in the \"Annalen der Physik\", the leading German physics journal. These are the papers that history has come to call the \"Annus Mirabilis Papers\":\nAll four papers are today recognized as tremendous achievements\u2014and hence 1905 is known as Einstein's \"Wonderful Year\". At the time, however, they were not noticed by most physicists as being important, and many of those who did notice them rejected them outright. Some of this work\u2014such as the theory of light quanta\u2014remained controversial for years.\nAt the age of 26, having studied under Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. His dissertation was entitled \"A new determination of molecular dimensions.\" \nLight and general relativity.\nIn 1906, the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class, but he was not giving up on academia. In 1908, he became a privatdozent at the University of Bern. In 1910, he wrote a paper on critical opalescence that described the cumulative effect of light scattered by individual molecules in the atmosphere, i.e. why the sky is blue.\nDuring 1909, Einstein published \"\u00dcber die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen \u00fcber das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung\" (\"\"), on the quantization of light. In this and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles. This paper introduced the \"photon\" concept (although the term itself was introduced by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave\u2013particle duality in quantum mechanics.\nIn 1911, Einstein became an associate professor at the University of Zurich. However, shortly afterward, he accepted a full professorship at the Charles University of Prague. While in Prague, Einstein published a paper about the effects of gravity on light, specifically the gravitational redshift and the gravitational deflection of light. The paper appealed to astronomers to find ways of detecting the deflection during a solar eclipse. German astronomer Erwin Freundlich publicized Einstein's challenge to scientists around the world.\nIn 1912, Einstein returned to Switzerland to accept a professorship at his alma mater, the ETH. There he met mathematician Marcel Grossmann who introduced him to Riemannian geometry, and at the recommendation of Italian mathematician Tullio Levi-Civita, Einstein began exploring the usefulness of general covariance (essentially the use of tensors) for his gravitational theory. Although for a while Einstein thought that there were problems with that approach, he later returned to it and by late 1915 had published his general theory of relativity in the form that is still used today . This theory explains gravitation as distortion of the structure of spacetime by matter, affecting the inertial motion of other matter.\nAfter many relocations, Mileva established a permanent home with the children in Zurich in 1914, just before the start of World War I. Einstein continued on alone to Berlin, where he became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. As part of the arrangements for his new position, he also became a professor at the University of Berlin, although with a special clause freeing him from most teaching obligations. From 1914 to 1932 he was also director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for physics.\nDuring World War I, the speeches and writings of Central Powers scientists were available only to Central Powers academics, for national security reasons. Some of Einstein's work did reach the United Kingdom and the United States through the efforts of the Austrian Paul Ehrenfest and physicists in the Netherlands, especially 1902 Nobel Prize-winner Hendrik Lorentz and Willem de Sitter of the Leiden University. After the war ended, Einstein maintained his relationship with the Leiden University, accepting a contract as an \"Extraordinary Professor\"; he travelled to Holland regularly to lecture there between 1920 and 1930.\nIn 1917, Einstein published an article in \"Physikalische Zeitschrift\" that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser . He also published a paper introducing a new notion, a cosmological constant, into the general theory of relativity in an attempt to model the behavior of the entire universe .\n1917 was the year astronomers began taking Einstein up on his 1911 challenge from Prague. The Mount Wilson Observatory in California, U.S., published a solar spectroscopic analysis that showed no gravitational redshift. In 1918, the Lick Observatory, also in California, announced that they too had disproven Einstein's prediction, although their findings were not published\nHowever, in May 1919, a team led by British astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington claimed to have confirmed Einstein's prediction of gravitational deflection of starlight by the Sun while photographing a solar eclipse in Sobral northern Brazil and Principe. On November 7, 1919, leading British newspaper \"The Times\" printed a banner headline that read: \"Revolution in Science \u2013 New Theory of the Universe \u2013 Newtonian Ideas Overthrown\". In an interview Nobel laureate Max Born praised general relativity as the \"greatest feat of human thinking about nature\"; fellow laureate Paul Dirac was quoted saying it was \"probably the greatest scientific discovery ever made\".\nIn their excitement, the world media made Albert Einstein world-famous. Ironically, later examination of the photographs taken on the Eddington expedition showed that the experimental uncertainty was of about the same magnitude as the effect Eddington claimed to have demonstrated, and in 1962 a British expedition concluded that the method used was inherently unreliable. The deflection of light during a solar eclipse has, however, been more accurately measured (and confirmed) by later observations.\nThere was some resentment toward the newcomer Einstein's fame in the scientific community, notably among German physicists, who later started the \"Deutsche Physik\" (German Physics) movement.\nHaving lived apart for five years, Einstein and Mileva divorced on February 14, 1919. On June 2 of that year, Einstein married Elsa L\u00f6wenthal, who had nursed him through an illness. Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally). Together the Einsteins raised Margot and Ilse, Elsa's daughters from her first marriage.\nNobel Prize.\nIn 1921 Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". This refers to his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect: \"On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light\", which was well supported by the experimental evidence by that time. The presentation speech began by mentioning \"his theory of relativity [which had] been the subject of lively debate in philosophical circles [and] also has astrophysical implications which are being rigorously examined at the present time.\" As per their divorce settlement, Einstein gave the Nobel prize money to his first wife, Mileva Mari\u0107.\nEinstein traveled to New York City in the United States for the first time on April 2, 1921. When asked where he got his scientific ideas, Einstein explained that he believed scientific work best proceeds from an examination of physical reality and a search for underlying axioms, with consistent explanations that apply in all instances and avoid contradicting each other. He also recommended theories with visualizable results .\nUnified field theory.\nEinstein's research after general relativity consisted primarily of a long series of attempts to generalize his theory of gravitation in order to unify and simplify the fundamental laws of physics, particularly gravitation and electromagnetism. In 1950, he described this \"Unified Field Theory\" in a \"Scientific American\" article entitled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\" .\nAlthough he continued to be lauded for his work in theoretical physics, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his attempts were ultimately unsuccessful. In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, he ignored some mainstream developments in physics (and vice versa), most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until many years after Einstein's death. Einstein's goal of unifying the laws of physics under a single model survives in the current drive for the grand unification theory.\nCollaboration and conflict.\nBose\u2013Einstein statistics.\nIn 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose which showed that light could be understood as a gas. Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and Einstein submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik\". Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate phenomenon that should appear at very low temperatures . It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST-JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Bose\u2013Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of \"bosons\". Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.\nSchr\u00f6dinger gas model.\nEinstein suggested to Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger an application of Max Planck's idea of treating energy levels for a gas as a whole rather than for individual molecules, and Schr\u00f6dinger applied this in a paper using the Boltzmann distribution to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas. Schr\u00f6dinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.\nEinstein refrigerator.\nIn 1926, Einstein and his former student Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd, a Hungarian physicist who later worked on the Manhattan Project and is credited with the discovery of the chain reaction, co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator, revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat, not ice, as an input.\nBohr versus Einstein.\nIn the 1920s, quantum mechanics developed into a more complete theory. Einstein was unhappy with the \"Copenhagen interpretation\" of quantum theory developed by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, wherein quantum phenomena are inherently probabilistic, with definite states resulting only upon interaction with classical systems. A public debate between Einstein and Bohr followed, lasting for many years (including during the Solvay Conferences). Einstein formulated thought experiments against the Copenhagen interpretation, which were all rebutted by Bohr. In a 1926 letter to Max Born, Einstein wrote: \"I, at any rate, am convinced that He [God] does not throw dice.\" .\nEinstein was never satisfied by what he perceived to be quantum theory's intrinsically incomplete description of nature, and in 1935 he further explored the issue in collaboration with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, noting that the theory seems to require non-local interactions; this is known as the EPR paradox . The EPR experiment has since been performed, with results confirming quantum theory's predictions.\nEinstein's disagreement with Bohr revolved around the idea of scientific determinism. For this reason the repercussions of the Einstein-Bohr debate have found their way into philosophical discourse as well.\nReligious views.\nThe question of scientific determinism gave rise to questions about Einstein's position on theological determinism, and even whether or not he believed in God. In 1929, Einstein told Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein \"I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.\" In 1950, in a letter to M. Berkowitz, Einstein stated that \"My position concerning God is that of an agnostic. I am convinced that a vivid consciousness of the primary importance of moral principles for the betterment and ennoblement of life does not need the idea of a law-giver, especially a law-giver who works on the basis of reward and punishment.\"\nEinstein defined his religious views in a letter he wrote in response to those who claimed that he worshipped a Judeo-Christian god: \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.\"\nBy his own definition, Einstein was a deeply religious person: \"A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, of the manifestations of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which are only accessible to our reason in their most elementary forms--it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious attitude; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a deeply religious man.\" He published a paper in \"Nature\" in 1940 entitled \"Science and Religion\" which gave his views on the subject. In this he says that: \"a person who is religiously enlightened appears to me to be one who has, to the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings and aspirations to which he clings because of their super-personal value\u00a0... regardless of whether any attempt is made to unite this content with a Divine Being, for otherwise it would not be possible to count Buddha and Spinoza as religious personalities. Accordingly a religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt of the significance of those super-personal objects and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational foundation\u00a0... In this sense religion is the age-old endeavour of mankind to become clearly and completely conscious of these values and goals, and constantly to strengthen their effects.\" He argues that conflicts between science and religion \"have all sprung from fatal errors.\" However \"even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other\" there are \"strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies\"\u00a0... \"science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind\u00a0... a legitimate conflict between science and religion cannot exist.\" However he makes it clear that he does not believe in a personal God, and suggests that \"neither the rule of human nor Divine Will exists as an independent cause of natural events. To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be \"refuted\"\u00a0... by science, for [it] can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\" \nHis friend Max Jammer explored Einstein's views on religion thoroughly in the 1999 book \"Einstein and Religion: Physics and Theology.\"\nPolitics.\nWith increasing public demands, his involvement in political, humanitarian, and academic projects in various countries, and his new acquaintances with scholars and political figures from around the world, Einstein was less able to achieve the productive isolation that, according to biographer Ronald W. Clark, he needed in order to work. Due to his fame and genius, Einstein found himself called on to give conclusive judgments on matters that had nothing to do with theoretical physics or mathematics. He was not timid, and he was aware of the world around him, with no illusion that ignoring politics would make world events fade away. His very visible position allowed him to speak and write frankly, even provocatively, at a time when many people of conscience could only flee to the underground or keep doubts about developments within their own movements to themselves for fear of internecine fighting. Einstein flouted the ascendant Nazi movement, tried to be a voice of moderation in the tumultuous formation of the State of Israel and braved anti-communist politics and resistance to the civil rights movement in the United States. He participated in the 1927 congress of the League against Imperialism in Brussels.\nZionism.\nEinstein was a cultural Zionist. In 1931, The Macmillan Company published \"About Zionism: Speeches and Lectures by Professor Albert Einstein\". Querido, an Amsterdam publishing house, collected eleven of Einstein's essays into a 1933 book entitled \"Mein Weltbild\", translated to English as \"The World as I See It\"; Einstein's foreword dedicates the collection \"to the Jews of Germany\". In the face of Germany's rising militarism, Einstein wrote and spoke for peace.\nDespite his years of Zionist efforts, Einstein publicly stated reservations about the proposal to partition the British-supervised British Mandate of Palestine into independent Arab and Jewish countries. In a 1938 speech, \"Our Debt to Zionism\", he said: \"I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain\u2014especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state.\" \nThe United Nations did divide the mandate, demarcating the borders of several new countries including the State of Israel, and war broke out immediately. Einstein was one of the authors of a 1948 letter to the New York Times criticizing Menachem Begin's Revisionist Herut (Freedom) Party for the Deir Yassin massacre .\nEinstein served on the Board of Governors of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In his Will of 1950, Einstein bequeathed literary rights to his writings to The Hebrew University, where many of his original documents are held in the Albert Einstein Archives.\nWhen President Chaim Weizmann died in 1952, Einstein was asked to be Israel's second president, but he declined. He wrote: \"I am deeply moved by the offer from our State of Israel, and at once saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept it.\"\nNazism.\nIn January 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany. One of the first actions of Hitler's administration was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which removed Jews and politically suspect government employees (including university professors) from their jobs, unless they had demonstrated their loyalty to Germany by serving in World War I. In December 1932, in response to this growing threat, Einstein had prudently traveled to the U.S. For several years he had been wintering at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, and also was a guest lecturer at Abraham Flexner's newly founded Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.\nThe Einstein family bought a house in Princeton (where Elsa died in 1936), and Einstein remained an integral contributor to the Institute for Advanced Study until his death in 1955. During the 1930s and into World War II, Einstein wrote affidavits recommending United States visas for a huge number of Jews from Europe trying to flee persecution, raised money for Zionist organizations and was in part responsible for the formation, in 1933, of the International Rescue Committee.\nMeanwhile in Germany, a campaign to eliminate Einstein's work from the German lexicon as unacceptable \"Jewish physics\" (\"J\u00fcdische physik\") was led by Nobel laureates Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark. \"Deutsche Physik\" activists published pamphlets and even textbooks denigrating Einstein, and instructors who taught his theories were blacklisted\u2014including Nobel laureate Werner Heisenberg, who had debated quantum probability with Bohr and Einstein. Philipp Lenard claimed that the mass\u2013energy equivalence formula needed to be credited to Friedrich Hasen\u00f6hrl to make it an Aryan creation.\nEinstein became a citizen of the United States in 1940, although he retained his Swiss citizenship.\nAtomic bomb.\nConcerned scientists, many of them refugees from European anti-Semitism in the U.S., recognized the possibility that German scientists were working toward developing an atomic bomb. They knew that Einstein's fame might make their fears more believable. In 1939, Einstein signed a letter to U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt written by Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd warning that based on Szil\u00e1rd's research the Third Reich might be developing nuclear weapons. \nThe United States took stock of this warning, and within five years, the U.S. created its own nuclear weapons, and used them on the Japanese cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. According to chemist and author Linus Pauling, Einstein later expressed regret about the Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd letter.\nAlong with other prominent individuals such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Henry Morgenthau, Jr., Einstein in 1947 participated in a \"National Conference on the German Problem,\" which produced a declaration stating that \"any plans to resurrect the economic and political power of Germany\u2026 [were] dangerous to the security of the world.\"\nCold War era.\nWhen he was a visible figure working against the rise of Nazism, Einstein had sought help and developed working relationships in both the West and what was to become the Soviet bloc. After World War II, enmity between the former allies became a very serious issue for people with international r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. To make things worse, during the first days of McCarthyism Einstein was writing about a single world government; it was at this time that he wrote, \"I do not know how the third World War will be fought, but I can tell you what they will use in the Fourth\u2014rocks!\" In a 1949 \"Monthly Review\" article entitled \"Why Socialism?\" Albert Einstein described a chaotic capitalist society, a source of evil to be overcome, as the \"predatory phase of human development\" . With Albert Schweitzer and Bertrand Russell, Einstein lobbied to stop nuclear testing and future bombs. Days before his death, Einstein signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto, which led to the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs.\nEinstein was a member of several civil rights groups, including the Princeton chapter of the NAACP. When the aged W. E. B. Du Bois was accused of being a Communist spy, Einstein volunteered as a character witness, and the case was dismissed shortly afterward. Einstein's friendship with activist Paul Robeson, with whom he served as co-chair of the American Crusade to End Lynching, lasted 20 years.\nIn 1946, Einstein collaborated with Rabbi Israel Goldstein, Middlesex heir C. Ruggles Smith, and activist attorney George Alpert on the Albert Einstein Foundation for Higher Learning, Inc., which was formed to create a Jewish-sponsored secular university, open to all students, on the grounds of the former Middlesex College in Waltham, Massachusetts. Middlesex was chosen in part because it was accessible from both Boston and New York City, Jewish cultural centers of the U.S. Their vision was a university \"deeply conscious both of the Hebraic tradition of Torah looking upon culture as a birthright, and of the American ideal of an educated democracy.\" The collaboration was stormy, however. Finally, when Einstein wanted to appoint British economist Harold J. Laski as the university's president, Alpert wrote that Laski was \"a man utterly alien to American principles of democracy, tarred with the Communist brush.\" Einstein withdrew his support and barred the use of his name. The university opened in 1948 as Brandeis University. In 1953, Brandeis offered Einstein an honorary degree, but he declined.\nGiven Einstein's links to Germany and Zionism, his socialistic ideals, and his perceived links to Communist figures, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation kept a file on Einstein that grew to 1,427 pages. Many of the documents in the file were sent to the FBI by concerned citizens: some objecting to his immigration, while others asked the FBI to protect him.\nAlthough Einstein had long been sympathetic to the notion of vegetarianism, it was only near the start of 1954 that he adopted a strict vegetarian diet.\nDeath.\nOn April 17, 1955, Albert Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an aortic aneurism. He took a draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it. He died in Princeton Hospital early the next morning at the age of 76. Einstein's remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered.\nBefore the cremation, Princeton Hospital pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed Einstein's brain for preservation, in hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent.\nLegacy.\nWhile travelling, Einstein had written daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters, Margot and Ilse, and the letters were included in the papers bequeathed to The Hebrew University. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986). Barbara Wolff, of The Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.\nThe United States' National Academy of Sciences commissioned the \"Albert Einstein Memorial\", a monumental bronze and marble sculpture by Robert Berks, dedicated in 1979 at its Washington, D.C. campus adjacent to the National Mall.\nEinstein bequeathed the royalties from use of his image to The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The Roger Richman Agency licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the Hebrew University.\nHonors.\nIn 1999, Albert Einstein was named \"Person of the Century\" by \"Time\" magazine, the Gallup Poll recorded him as the fourth most admired person of the 20th century and according to \"The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History\", Einstein is \"the greatest scientist of the twentieth century and one of the supreme intellects of all time.\"\nA partial list of his memorials:\nIn 1990, his name was added to the Walhalla temple.\nImpact on popular culture.\nIn the period before World War II, Albert Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain \"that theory\". He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. He told his inquirers \"Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein.\"\nAlbert Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, and plays. Einstein is a favorite model for depictions of mad scientists and absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. \"Time\" magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was \"a cartoonist's dream come true.\"\nPublications.\nThe following publications by Albert Einstein are referenced in this article.

His middle name was given in honor of his godfather, the physicist Ernst Mach. Pauli's father, Wolfgang Pauli, Sr. (originally Wolf Pascheles), whose parents came from prominent Jewish families of Prague, converted from Judaism to Roman Catholicism shortly before his marriage in 1899. Bertha Sch\u00fctz was raised in her mother's Roman Catholic religion, but her father was the Jewish writer Friedrich Sch\u00fctz. Although Pauli was raised as a Roman Catholic, eventually he (and his parents) left the Church. \nPauli attended the D\u00f6blinger-Gymnasium in Vienna, graduating with distinction in 1918. Only two months after graduation, the young prodigy had published his first paper, on Einstein's theory of general relativity. He attended the Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, working under Sommerfeld, where he received his doctorate in July 1921 for a thesis on the quantum theory of ionised molecular hydrogen.\nSommerfeld asked Pauli to review the theory of relativity for the \"Encyklopaedie der mathematischen Wissenschaften\" (\"Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences\"), a German encyclopedia. Two months after receiving his doctorate, Pauli completed the article, which came to 237 pages. It was praised by Einstein; published as a monograph, it remains a standard reference on the subject to this day.\nHe spent a year at the University of G\u00f6ttingen as the assistant to Max Born, and the following year at what became the Niels Bohr Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen. He then spent 1923 to 1928 as a lecturer at the University of Hamburg. During this period, Pauli was instrumental in the development of the modern theory of quantum mechanics. In particular, he formulated the exclusion principle and the theory of nonrelativistic spin. (See below for a list of his scientific contributions.)\nIn May 1929, Pauli left the Roman Catholic Church; in December that year, he married K\u00e4the Margarethe Deppner. The marriage was an unhappy one, ending in divorce in 1930 after less than a year.\nAt the beginning of 1931, shortly after his divorce and immediately following his postulation of the neutrino, Pauli had a severe breakdown. He consulted the psychiatrist and psychotherapist Carl Jung who, like Pauli, lived near Zurich. Jung immediately began to interpret his deeply archetypal dreams and Pauli became one of the depth psychologist\u2019s best students. Soon, he began to scientifically criticize the epistemology of Jung\u2019s theory and this contributed to a certain clarification of the latter\u2019s thoughts, especially about the concept of synchronicity. A great deal of these discussions is documented in the Pauli/Jung letters, today published as \u201cAtom and Archetype\u201d. Jung's elaborate analysis of more than 400 of Pauli's dreams is documented in \u201cPsychology and Alchemy\u201d (see below). \nIn 1928, he was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the ETH Zurich in Switzerland where he made significant scientific progress. He held visiting professorships at the University of Michigan in 1931, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1935. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1931.\nIn 1934, he married Franciska Bertram. This marriage would last for the rest of his life. They had no children.\nThe German annexation of Austria in 1938 made him a German national, which became a difficulty with the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. Pauli moved to the United States in 1940, where he was Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton. After the end of the war, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1946 before returning to Zurich, where he mostly remained for the rest of his life.\nAlso in 1945, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his \"decisive contribution through his discovery in 1925 of a new law of Nature, the exclusion principle or Pauli principle.\" He had been nominated for the prize by Einstein.\nIn 1958, Pauli was awarded the Max Planck medal. In that same year, he fell ill with pancreatic cancer. When his last assistant, Charles Enz, visited him at the Rotkreuz hospital in Zurich, Pauli asked him: \u201cDid you see the room number?\u201d It was number 137. Throughout his life, Pauli had been preoccupied with the question of why the fine structure constant, a dimensionless fundamental constant, has a value nearly equal to 1/137. Pauli died in that room on December 15, 1958.\nScientific career.\nPauli made many important contributions in his career as a physicist, primarily in the subject of quantum mechanics. He seldom published papers, preferring lengthy correspondences with colleagues (such as Bohr and Heisenberg, with whom he had close friendships.) Many of his ideas and results were never published and appeared only in his letters, which were often copied and circulated by their recipients. Pauli was apparently unconcerned that much of his work thus went uncredited. The following are the most important results for which he \"has\" been credited:\nIn 1924, Pauli proposed a new quantum degree of freedom (or quantum number) with two possible values, in order to resolve inconsistencies between observed molecular spectra and the developing theory of quantum mechanics. He formulated the Pauli exclusion principle, perhaps his most important work, which stated that no two electrons could exist in the same quantum state, identified by four quantum numbers including his new two-valued degree of freedom. The idea of spin had originated with Ralph Kronig. Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit one year later identified Pauli's new degree of freedom as electron spin.\nIn 1926, shortly after Heisenberg published the matrix theory of modern quantum mechanics, Pauli used it to derive the observed spectrum of the hydrogen atom. This result was important in securing credibility for Heisenberg's theory.\nIn 1927, he introduced the 2x2 Pauli matrices as a basis of spin operators, thus solving the nonrelativistic theory of spin. This work is sometimes said to have influenced Dirac in his discovery of the Dirac equation for the relativistic electron, though Dirac stated that he invented these same matrices himself independently at the time, without Pauli's influence. Dirac invented similar but larger (4x4) spin matrices for use in his relativistic treatment of fermionic spin.\nIn 1930, Pauli considered the problem of beta decay. In a letter of Dec 4 beginning \"Dear radioactive ladies and gentlemen\" (to Lise Meitner et al.), he proposed the existence of a hitherto unobserved neutral particle with a small mass (no greater than 1% the mass of a proton), in order to explain the continuous spectrum of beta decay. In 1934, Fermi incorporated the particle, which he called a neutrino, into his theory of beta decay. The neutrino was first confirmed experimentally in 1956 by Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan, two and a half years before Pauli's death. On receiving the news, he replied by telegram: \"Thanks for message. Everything comes to him who knows how to wait. Pauli\"\nIn 1940, he proved the spin-statistics theorem, a critical result of quantum field theory which states that particles with half-integer spin are fermions, while particles with integer spin are bosons.\nIn 1949, he published a paper on Pauli-Villars regularization, which provides an important prescription for renormalization, or removing infinities from quantum field theories.\nPauli made repeated criticisms of modern synthesis of evolutionary biology, and his contemporary admirers point to modes of epigenetic inheritance as supportive of his arguments.\nPersonality and reputation.\nThe Pauli effect was named after his bizarre ability to break experimental equipment simply by being in the vicinity. Pauli himself was aware of his reputation, and delighted whenever the Pauli effect manifested. \nRegarding physics, Pauli was famously perfectionist. This extended not just to his own work, but also to the work of his colleagues. As a result, he became known within the physics community as the \"conscience of physics\", the critic to whom his colleagues were accountable. He could be scathing in his dismissal of any theory he found lacking, often labelling it \"ganz falsch\", utterly false. \nHowever, this was not his most severe criticism, which he reserved for theories or theses so unclearly presented as to be untestable or unevaluatable, and thus not properly belonging within the realm of science, even though posing as such. They were worse than wrong because they could not be proven wrong. Famously, he once said of such an unclear paper: \"It is not even wrong.\"\nAn incident reported to have occurred with another leading physicist of the time, Paul Ehrenfest, illustrates this notion of an arrogant Pauli. The two met at a conference for the first time. Ehrenfest, though never having met Pauli, was familiar with his papers, and was quite impressed with them. After a few minutes of conversation, Ehrenfest remarked \"I think I like your papers better than you\", to which Pauli shot back \"I think I like you better than your papers\". The two became very good friends from then on.\nA well-known joke about Pauli in the physics community goes as follows: After his death, Pauli was granted an audience with God. Pauli asked God why the fine structure constant has the value 1/(137.036...). God nodded, went to a blackboard, and began scribbling equations at a furious pace. Pauli watched Him at first with great satisfaction, but soon began shaking his head violently: \"Das ist ganz falsch!\"\nA somewhat warmer picture emerges from this story which appears in the article on Dirac:\n\"Werner Heisenberg [in \"Physics and Beyond\", 1971] recollects a friendly conversation among young participants at the 1927 Solvay Conference about Einstein and Planck's views on religion. Wolfgang Pauli, Heisenberg and Dirac took part in it. Dirac's contribution was a poignant and clear criticism of the political manipulation of religion, that was much appreciated for its lucidity by Bohr, when Heisenberg reported it to him later. Among other things, Dirac said: \"I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest - and as scientists honesty is our precise duty - we cannot help but admit that any religion is a pack of false statements, deprived of any real foundation. The very idea of God is a product of human imagination. [...] I do not recognize any religious myth, at least because they contradict one another. [...]\" Heisenberg's view was tolerant. Pauli had kept silent, after some initial remarks, but when finally he was asked for his opinion, jokingly he said: \"Well, I'd say that also our friend Dirac has got a religion and the first commandment of this religion is 'God does not exist and Paul Dirac is his prophet.'\" Everybody burst into laughter, including Dirac.\nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;", "score": 0.6864967104013342, "question": null, "meta": {"name": "Wolfgang Pauli", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33972", "vector_id": "977742"}, "embedding": null, "id": "7d872d1054992457ab870b868c31cc55"}, {"text": "Eugene Paul Wigner (usually E. P. Wigner among physicists) (Hungarian Wigner P\u00e1l Jen\u0151) (November 17, 1902 \u2013 January 1, 1995) was a Hungarian physicist and mathematician. \nHe received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 \"for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles\". Some contemporaries referred to Wigner as \"the Silent Genius\" and some even considered him the intellectual equal to Albert Einstein, though without the prominence. Wigner is important for having laid the foundation for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics as well as for his research into atomic nuclei, and for his several theorems.\nEarly life.\nWigner was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary (now Hungary) to a Jewish Middle class family. At age 11, Wigner contracted what his parents believed was tuberculosis. They sent him for six weeks to a sanitorium in the Austrian mountains. During this period, Wigner began to develop an interest in mathematical problems. From 1915 till 1919, concurrently with John von Neumann, Wigner studied at the Lutheran Fasori Evang\u00e9likus Gimn\u00e1zium where they both greatly benefited from encouragement by the legendary mathematics teacher L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz. In 1919, to escape the Bela Kun communist regime, the family briefly moved to Austria, returning after the downfall of the Kun government. Partly as a reaction to the prominent presence of Jews in the Kun regime, the family converted to Lutheranism.\nIn 1921, Wigner studied chemical engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Berlin (today the Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin). He also attended the Wednesday afternoon colloquia of the German Physical Society. These colloquia featured such luminaries as Max Planck, Max von Laue, Rudolf Ladenburg, Werner Heisenberg, Walther Nernst, Wolfgang Pauli and \u2014 most of all \u2014 Albert Einstein. Wigner also met physicist Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd, who at once became Wigner's closest friend. A third experience in Berlin was formative. Wigner worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry, today Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society, and there met Michael Polanyi, who would become, after L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz, Wigner's greatest teacher.\nMiddle years.\nIn the late 1920s, Wigner deeply explored the field of quantum mechanics. A period at G\u00f6ttingen as an assistant to the great mathematician David Hilbert proved a disappointment, as Hilbert was no longer active in his works. Wigner nonetheless studied independently. He laid the foundation for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics and in 1927 introduced what is now known\nas the Wigner D-matrix.\nIt is safe to state that he and Hermann Weyl carry the sole responsibility for the introduction of group theory into quantum mechanics (they spread the \"Gruppenpest\"). See Wigner's 1931 monograph for a survey of his work on group theory. In the late 1930s, he extended his research into atomic nuclei. He developed an important general theory of nuclear reactions (see for instance the Wigner-Eckart theorem). By 1929, his papers were drawing notice in the physics world. In 1930, Princeton University recruited Wigner and Von Neumann, which was timely as the Nazi Regime in Germany emerged. In Princeton in 1934 Wigner introduced his sister Manci to the physicist Paul Dirac. They married, and the ties between Wigner and Dirac deepened. \nIn 1936, Princeton did not rehire Wigner, so he moved to the University of Wisconsin-Madison. There he met his first wife, a physics student named Amelia Frank. Yet she died in 1937, leaving Wigner distraught. On January 8, 1937, Wigner became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Princeton University shortly invited Wigner back, and he rejoined faculty in the fall of 1938. Though a professed political amateur, in 1939 and 1940 Dr. Wigner played a major role in agitating for the Manhattan Project, which would develop the first atomic bomb. However, he was by personal preference a pacifist. He would later contribute to civil defense in the US. In 1946, Wigner accepted a job as director of research and development at Clinton Laboratory (now Oak Ridge National Laboratory) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. When this did not work out especially well, Wigner returned to Princeton.\nIn 1941 Wigner married his second wife, Mary Annette Wheeler, who had received her PhD in physics from Yale in 1932 and was a professor at Vassar. They were married until her death in 1977 and had two children.\nIn appreciation of Professor Wigner, written 1987, Alvin M. Weinberg stated: \"\u2026this tract of Wigner\u2019s [giving credit to his young collaborators] explains why so much, not only of reactor theory but of theoretical physics from 1930 to 1965 \u2014 though it may not bear Wigner\u2019s name \u2014 actually has origin in a suggestion made or question asked by Professor Wigner.\"\nLast years.\nIn 1960, Wigner gave a thought-provoking insight into the power of mathematics in his best-known essay outside physics, now a classic paper, \"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences.\" He argued that biology and cognition could be the origin of physical concepts, as we humans perceive them, and that the happy coincidence that mathematics and physics were so well matched, seemed to be \"unreasonable\" and hard to explain. Even so, he found resistance to this theory, notably by distinguished mathematician Andrew M. Gleason. In 1963, Wigner received the Nobel Prize in Physics. He professed never to have even considered the possibility that this might occur, and added: \"I never expected to get my name in the newspapers without doing something wicked.\" He would later go on to win the Enrico Fermi award, and the National Medal of Science. In 1992, at the age of 90, he published a memoir, \"The Recollections of Eugene P. Wigner\" with Andrew Szanton. Wigner died three years later in Princeton. One of his significant students was Abner Shimony.\nWigner was asked in the late 1970s 'Do you remember R\u00e1tz?', one of his teachers, to which he answered: 'There he is!' and pointed to a picture of R\u00e1tz on his office wall.\nHis third wife was Patricia Hamilton Wigner, widow of another physicist, Donald Ross Hamilton, retired Dean of the Graduate School at Princeton University who passed away in 1971.\nNear the end of his life his thought turned more philosophical. In his memoir, Wigner said: \"The full meaning of life, the collective meaning of all human desires, is fundamentally a mystery beyond our grasp. As a young man, I chafed at this state of affairs. But by now I have made peace with it. I even feel a certain honor to be associated with such a mystery\". He developed interest in the [[Vedanta] philosophy] of [[Hinduism]], particularly with its ideas of the universe as an all pervading [[consciousness]]. In his collection of essays (Symmetries and Reflections- Scientific Essays), he commented \"It was not possible to formulate the laws (of quantum theory) in a fully consistent way without reference to consciousness\".\nAlso in the realm of theoretics is the thought experiment, [[Wigner's friend]] paradox. It is often seen as an extension of the [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]] thought experiment. The Wigner's friend experiment asks the question: at what stage does a \"measurement\" take place? Wigner designed the experiment to highlight how he believed consciousness is necessary to the quantum mechanical measurement process.\nExternal links.\n[[Category:1902 births|Wigner, Eugene Paul]]\n[[Category:1995 deaths|Wigner, Eugene Paul]]\n[[Category:Theoretical physicists|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[Category:Nobel laureates in Physics|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[Category:Hungarian Nobel laureates|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[Category:Hungarian physicists|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[Category:Hungarian mathematicians|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[Category:American Jews|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[Category:Hungarian Jews|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[Category:Jewish scientists|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[Category:20th century mathematicians|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[Category:National Medal of Science laureates|Wigner]]\n[[Category:Enrico Fermi Award recipients|Wigner]]\n[[Category:Hungarian-Americans|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[Category:Georg-August University of G\u00f6ttingen faculty|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison faculty|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[Category:Princeton University faculty|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[Category:Hungarian immigrants to the United States|Wigner, Eugene]]\n[[ca:Eugene Paul Wigner]]\n[[cs:Eugene Paul Wigner]]\n[[de:Eugene Paul Wigner]]\n[[es:Eugene Paul Wigner]]\n[[fa:\u06cc\u0648\u062c\u06cc\u0646 \u0648\u06cc\u06af\u0646\u0631]]\n[[fr:Eugene Wigner]]\n[[io:Eugene Wigner]]\n[[id:Eugene Wigner]]\n[[it:Eugene Wigner]]\n[[he:\u05d9\u05d5\u05d2'\u05d9\u05df \u05d5\u05d9\u05d2\u05e0\u05e8]]\n[[sw:Eugene Wigner]]\n[[hu:Wigner Jen\u0151]]\n[[ja:\u30e6\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30b0\u30ca\u30fc]]\n[[oc:Eugene Wigner]]\n[[pl:Eugene Wigner]]\n[[pt:Eugene Paul Wigner]]\n[[ru:\u0412\u0438\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0440, \u042e\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043d]]\n[[sk:Eugene Paul Wigner]]\n[[sl:Eugene Paul Wigner]]\n[[fi:Eugene Wigner]]\n[[sv:Eugene Wigner]]\n[[vi:Eugene Wigner]]\n[[zh:E\u00b7P\u00b7\u7ef4\u683c\u7eb3]]", "score": 0.6859683719083777, "question": null, "meta": {"name": "Eugene Wigner", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10101", "vector_id": "1216808"}, "embedding": null, "id": "985620a41f2c204cb936abecda8fe60e"}, {"text": "Murray Gell-Mann (born September 15, 1929) is an American physicist who received the 1969 Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the theory of elementary particles.\nBiography.\nBorn on New York's Lower East Side into a family of Jewish immigrants from Czernowitz. Gell-Mann quickly revealed himself as a child prodigy. Propelled by an intense boyhood curiosity and love for nature, he entered Yale at fifteen after graduating valedictorian from the Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School. He was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics in 1969 for his discovery of a system for classifying subatomic particles.\nGell-Mann's work in the 1950s involved recently discovered cosmic ray particles that came to be called kaons and hyperons. Classifying these particles led him to propose a new quantum number called strangeness. Another of Gell-Mann's triumphs is the Gell-Mann\u2013Nishijima formula, which was, initially, a formula from empirical results, but was later explained by the quark model. Gell-Mann and Abraham Pais were involved in explaining many puzzling aspects of the physics of these particles.\nIn 1961, this led him (and Kazuhiko Nishijima) to introduce a classification of elementary particles called hadrons (also independently proposed by Yuval Ne'eman at around the same time). This scheme is now explained by the quark model. Gell-Mann's own name for the classification scheme was the \"eightfold way\", because of the \"octets\" of particles in the classification, and also after the eightfold way of Buddhism \u2014 a choice that is reflective of Gell-Mann's eclectic interests.\nGell-Mann, and, independently, George Zweig, went on, in 1964, to postulate the existence of quarks, the particles from which the hadrons are composed. The name was coined by Gell-Mann and is a reference to the novel \"Finnegans Wake\", by James Joyce (\"Three quarks for Muster Mark!\" - book 2, episode 4). Zweig had referred to the particles as \"aces\" but Gell-Mann's name caught on.\nQuarks were soon accepted as the underlying elementary objects in the study of the structure of hadrons. \nIn 1972 he introduced with Harald Fritzsch the quantum number 'color' and later, in a joint paper with Heinrich Leutwyler, the full theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) was released. \nThe quark model is part of QCD, and has been robust enough to survive the discovery of other flavours of quarks.\nGell-Mann and Richard Feynman, working together, and a rival group of George Sudarshan and Robert Marshak, were the first to find the structure of the weak interaction in physics. This work followed the seminal discovery of parity violation by Chien-Shiung Wu, as suggested by Chen-Ning Yang and T. D. Lee.\nIn the 1990s his interest turned to the emerging study of complexity, where he was closely associated with the Santa Fe Institute. He wrote a popular science book about these matters, \"The Quark and the Jaguar: Adventures in the Simple and the Complex\". The title of the book is taken from a line of an Arthur Sze poem: \"The world of the quark has everything to do with a jaguar circling in the night.\"\nGeorge Johnson wrote a major biography of Gell-Mann, which is entitled \"Strange Beauty: Murray Gell-Mann and the Revolution in 20th-Century Physics.\"\nMurray Gell-Mann is also a collector of East Asian antiquities and a keen linguist.\nTimeline.\nHe earned a bachelor's degree in physics from Yale University in 1948, and a PhD in physics from MIT in 1951.Gell-Mann was a postdoctoral research associate in 1951 and a visiting research professor at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagin, Illinois from 1952-1953. \nAfter serving as Visiting Associate Professor at Columbia University in 1954-55, he became a professor at the University of Chicago before moving to the California Institute of Technology, where he taught from 1955 until 1993.\nHe is currently the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Theoretical Physics Emeritus at Caltech as well as a University Professor in the Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He is a member of the editorial board of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\". In 1984 Gell-Mann co-founded the Santa Fe Institute \u2014 a non-profit research institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico \u2014 to study complex systems and disseminate the notion of a separate interdisciplinary study of complexity theory.\nPersonal life.\nSpouse: J.

One of the later collaborators of Albert Einstein, he tried to achieve Einstein's vision of a unified field theory. He is also known as the coiner of the popular name of the well known space phenomenon, the black hole.\nBiographical summary.\nJohn Archibald Wheeler was born in Jacksonville, Florida. He graduated from the Baltimore City College high school in 1926 and received his doctorate from Johns Hopkins University in 1933. His thesis, under the supervision of Karl Herzfeld, was on the theory of the dispersion and adsorption of helium.\nHe was a professor of physics at Princeton University from 1938-1976, then a professor of physics at the University of Texas at Austin. The list of Professor Wheeler's graduate students includes Richard Feynman, Kip Thorne, and Hugh Everett. Unlike some scholars, he gave a high priority to teaching. He taught with enthusiasm, inspiration, and imagination. He was exemplary at finding ways to convey complex ideas in understandable terms. Even after he had achieved fame, he continued to teach freshman physics, saying that the young minds were the most important.\nWheeler made important contributions to theoretical physics. In 1937 he introduced the S-matrix, which became an indispensable tool in particle physics. He was a pioneer in the theory of nuclear fission, along with Niels Bohr and Enrico Fermi. In 1939 he collaborated with Bohr on the liquid drop model of nuclear fission. \nTogether with other leading physicists, during World War II Wheeler interrupted his academic career to participate in the development of the U.S. atomic bomb under the Manhattan Project at Hanford, WA, where reactors were constructed to produce plutonium for the bomb which was to be dropped on the Japanese city of Nagasaki. He went on to work on the development of the American hydrogen bomb under Project Matterhorn B.\nAfter concluding his Project Matterhorn work, Wheeler returned to Princeton to resume his academic career. In 1957, while working on extensions to general relativity, he introduced the word \"wormhole\" to describe tunnels in space-time.\nIn the 1950s, he formulated geometrodynamics, a program of physical and ontological reduction of every physical phenomenon, such as gravitation and electromagnetism, to the geometrical properties of a curved space-time. Aiming at a systematical identification of matter with space, \"geometrodynamics\" was often characterized as a continuation of the philosophy of nature as conceived by Descartes and Spinoza. Wheeler's geometrodynamics, however, failed to explain some important physical phenomena, such as the existence of fermions or that of gravitational singularities. Wheeler therefore abandoned this theory in the early 1970s. \nHis work in general relativity included the theory of gravitational collapse; he coined the term \"black hole\" in 1967. He was also a pioneer in the field of quantum gravity with his development (with Bryce DeWitt) of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation or, as he calls it, the \"wave function of the Universe.\"\nRecognizing Wheeler's colorful way with words, characterized by such confections as \"mass without mass\", the festschrift honoring his 60th birthday was fittingly entitled \"Magic Without Magic: John Archibald Wheeler: A collection of essays in honor of his sixtieth birthday,\" Ed: John R. Klauder, (W. H. Freeman, 1972, ISBN 0-7167-0337-8).\nIn 1979 Wheeler spoke to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), asking them to expel parapsychology, which had been admitted ten years earlier at the request of Margaret Mead. He called parapsychology a pseudoscience . His move was turned down and the Parapsychological Association remained a member of the AAAS. \nWheeler was awarded the Wolf Prize in Physics in 1997. He maintained an office in Jadwin Hall at Princeton up until 2006.\nWheeler is almost metaphysical in speculating that the laws of physics may be evolving in a manner analogous to evolution by natural selection in biology. \"How does something arise from nothing?\", he asks about the existence of space and time (\"Princeton Physics News\", 2006).", "score": 0.6846152391136633, "question": null, "meta": {"name": "John Archibald Wheeler", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=327127", "vector_id": "2065787"}, "embedding": null, "id": "f742a86383aa14842a7dc1e220f79b8c"}, {"text": "Due to Einstein's prolific output, the term Einstein effect may refer, to any one of a large number of possible effects, appearing in in different fields of physics. \nThese may include:\nand more specifically, ", "score": 0.6835865261410349, "question": null, "meta": {"name": "Einstein effect", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6264267", "vector_id": "424958"}, "embedding": null, "id": "3f8d756ddb20f17e82620d1cce85a05f"}, {"text": "Ernst Gabor Straus (February 25 1922 &amp;ndash July 12 1983) was a German-American mathematician who helped found the theories of Euclidean Ramsey theory and of the arithmetic properties of analytic functions.

He studied physics at Heidelberg, Lausanne, and, ultimately, the University of Berlin under Max Planck. In 1904, he completed his dissertation essay, \"\u00dcber die Reflexion des Lichts in einer inhomogenen Schicht\" (\"On the Reflection of Light in a Non-Homogeneous Medium\"). In 1908, he published \"Lebensweisheit\" (\"The Wisdom of Life\"), a slim volume about eudaemonism, the theory that happiness is the highest ethical pursuit. His habilitation essay, \"Das Wesen der Wahrheit nach der modernen Logik\" (\"The Nature of Truth According to Modern Logic\"), was published in 1910 . Several essays about aesthetics followed, whereupon Schlick turned his attention to problems of epistemology, the philosophy of science, and more general questions about science. In this last category, Schlick distinguished himself by publishing a paper in 1915 about Einstein's special theory of relativity, a topic only ten years old. He also published \"Raum und Zeit in der gegenw\u00e4rtigen Physik\" (\"Space and Time in Modern Physics\"), a more systematic treatment of post-Newtonian physics.\nMature Works and Life in Vienna.\nIn 1922, Schlick became a professor in the philosophy of inductive sciences at the University of Vienna after two unsatisfying appointments in Rostock and Kiel. In the same year occurred two events that shaped the remainder of Schlick's life. First, a group of philosophers and scientists (including but not limited to Rudolf Carnap, Herbert Feigl, Kurt G\u00f6del, Hans Hahn, Otto Neurath, and Friedrich Waismann) suggested to Schlick that they conduct regular meetings to discuss science and philosophy. They initially called themselves the Ernst Mach Association, but forever after they have been known as the Vienna Circle. The second great event of 1922 was the publication of Ludwig Wittgenstein's \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\", a work of terse, lapidary brilliance that advanced, among other things, a logical theory of symbolism and a 'picture theory' of language. Schlick and his group were overwhelmed by the work: they made it a topic for discussion at nearly every meeting. Schlick himself contacted Wittgenstein in 1924 and extolled the virtues of Wittgenstein's book vis-a-vis his immediate circle. Eventually Wittgenstein agreed to meet with Schlick and Waismann to discuss the \"Tractatus\" and other ideas. Through Schlick's influence, Wittgenstein was encouraged to consider a return to philosophy after some ten years of idleness. It is partly to Schlick's credit that Wittgenstein began to pen the reflections that make up large parts of \"Philosophical Investigations\". Schlick and Waismann's discussions with Wittgenstein continued until the latter felt that germinal ideas had been used without permission in an essay by Carnap. Wittgenstein continued discussions in letters to Schlick, but his formal association with the Vienna Circle ended in 1932.\nSchlick had worked on his \"Allgemeine Erkenntnislehre\" (\"General Theory of Knowledge\") between 1918 and 1925, and, though later developments in his philosophy were to make various contentions of his epistemology untenable, the \"General Theory\" is perhaps his greatest work in its acute reasoning against synthetic \"a priori\" knowledge. This critique of synthetic \"a priori\" knowledge argues that the only truths which are self-evident to reason are statements which are true as a matter of definition, such as the statements of formal logic and mathematics. The truth of all other statements must be evaluated with reference to empirical evidence. If a statement is proposed which is not a matter of definition, and not capable of being confirmed or falsified by evidence, that statement is \"metaphysical\", which is synonymous with \"meaningless\", or \"nonsense\". This is the principle upon which members of the Vienna Circle were most clearly in agreement. Between 1926 and 1930, Schlick labored to finish \"Fragen der Ethik\" (\"Problems of Ethics\"), in which he surprised some of his fellow Circlists by including ethics as a viable branch of philosophy. Also during this time, the Vienna Circle published \"The Scientific View of the World: The Vienna Circle\" as an homage to Schlick. Its strong anti-metaphysical stance crystallized the viewpoint of the group. \nRise of National Socialism and Death.\nWith the rise of the Nazis in Germany and Austria, many of the Vienna Circle's members left for America and the United Kingdom. Schlick, however, stayed on at the University of Vienna. When visited by Herbert Feigl in 1935, he expressed dismay at events in Germany. On June 22, 1936, Schlick was ascending the steps of the University for a class when he was confronted by a former student, Johann Nelb\u00f6ck, who drew a pistol and shot him in the chest. Schlick died very soon afterward. The student was tried and sentenced, but he became a \"cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\" for the growing anti-Jewish sentiments in the city. (That Schlick was not Jewish tended to be overlooked.) Nelb\u00f6ck was paroled shortly afterward and became a member of the Austrian Nazi Party after the \"Anschluss\".\nLegacy.\nSchlick's enduring contribution to the world of philosophy is as the fount of logical positivism. His humanity, good will, gentleness, and especially his encouragement have been documented by many of his peers.

His seminal work had a profound impact in numerous areas of mathematics and he is widely credited for introducing and popularizing modern notation and terminology, particularly in analysis.\nMathematical notation.\nEuler introduced much of the mathematical notation in use today, such as the notation \"f\"(\"x\") to describe a function and the modern notation for the trigonometric functions. He was the first to use the letter \"e\" for the base of the natural logarithm, now also known as Euler's number. The use of the Greek letter \u03c0 to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was also popularized (though not invented) by Euler. He is also credited for inventing the notation \"i\" to denote formula_1.\nComplex analysis.\nEuler made important contributions to complex analysis. He discovered what is now known as Euler's formula, that for any real number \u03a6, the complex exponential function satisfies\nThis has been called \"the most remarkable formula in mathematics\" by Richard Feynman. \n Euler's identity is a special case of this:\nThis identity is particularly remarkable as it involves \"e\", \"\u03c0\", \"i\", 1 and 0, arguably the five most important constants in mathematics.\nAnalysis.\nThe development of calculus was at the forefront of 18th century mathematical research, and the Bernoullis\u2014family friends of Euler\u2014were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Understanding the infinite was naturally the major focus of Euler's research. While some of Euler's proofs may not have been acceptable under modern standards of rigor, his ideas were responsible for many great advances. First of all, Euler introduced the concept of a function, and introduced the use of the exponential function and logarithms in analytic proofs. \nEuler frequently used the logarithm function as a tool in analysis problems, and discovered new ways by which they could be used. He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions in terms of power series, and successfully defined logarithms for complex and negative numbers, thus greatly expanding the scope where logarithms could be applied in mathematics. Most researchers in the field long held the view that formula_4 for any positive real formula_5 since by using the additivity property of logarithms formula_6. In a 1747 letter to Jean Le Rond d'Alembert, Euler defined the natural logarithm of -1 as formula_7 a pure imaginary. .\nEuler is well known in analysis for his frequent use and development of power series: that is, the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms, such as\nNotably, Euler discovered the power series expansions for \"e\" and the inverse tangent function \nHis daring (and, by modern standards, technically incorrect) use of power series enabled him to solve the famous Basel problem in 1735:\nIn addition, Euler elaborated the theory of higher transcendental functions by introducing the gamma function and introduced a new method for solving quartic equations. He also found a way to calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of complex analysis. Euler invented the calculus of variations including its most well-known result, the Euler-Lagrange equation. \nEuler also pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's work in this area led to the development of the prime number theorem.\nNumber theory.\nEuler's great interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of his friend in the St. Peterburg Academy, Christian Goldbach. A lot of his early work on number theory was based on the works of Pierre de Fermat, and developed some of Fermat's ideas while disproving some of his more outlandish conjectures. \nOne focus of Euler's work was to link the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis. He proved that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges. In doing so, he discovered the connection between Riemann zeta function and prime numbers, known as the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function.\nEuler proved Newton's identities, Fermat's little theorem, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, and made distinct contributions to the Lagrange's four-square theorem. He also invented the totient function \u03c6(n) which assigns to a positive integer n the number of positive integers less than n and coprime to n. Using properties of this function he was able to generalize Fermat's little theorem to what would become known as Euler's theorem. He further contributed significantly to the understanding of perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. Euler made progress toward the prime number theorem and conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The two concepts are regarded as the fundamental theorems of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for Carl Friedrich Gauss.\nGraph theory and topology.\nIn 1736 Euler solved, or rather proved unsolvable, a problem known as the seven bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg. The city of K\u00f6nigsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) is set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands which were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The question is whether it is possible to walk with a route that crosses each bridge exactly once, and return to the starting point.\nEuler's solution of the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory. In addition, his recognition that the key information was the number of bridges and the list of their endpoints (rather than their exact positions) presaged the development of topology.\nEuler also made contributions to the understanding of planar graphs. He introduced a formula governing the relationship between the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a convex polyhedron. Given such a polyhedron, the alternating sum of vertices, edges and faces equals a constant: V-E+F=2. This constant, \u03c7, is the Euler characteristic of the plane. The study and generalization of this equation, specially by Cauchy and Lhuillier, is at the origin of topology. Euler characteristic, which may be generalized to any topological space as the alternating sum of the Betti numbers, naturally arises from homology. In particular, it is equal to 2-2g for a closed oriented surface with genus g and to 2-k for a non-orientable surface with k crosscaps. This property led to the definition of rotation systems in topological graph theory.\nApplied mathematics.\nSome of Euler's greatest successes were in applying analytic methods to real world problems, describing numerous applications of Bernoulli's numbers, Fourier series, Venn diagrams, Euler numbers, e and \u03c0 constants, continued fractions and integrals. He integrated Leibniz's differential calculus with Newton's Method of Fluxions, and developed tools that made it easier to apply calculus to physical problems. In particular, he made great strides in improving numerical approximation of integrals, inventing what are now known as the \"Euler approximations\". The most notable of these approximations are Euler method and the Euler-Maclaurin formula. He also facilitated the use of differential equations, in particular introducing the Euler-Mascheroni constant: \nOne of Euler's more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in music. In 1739 he wrote the \"Tentamen novae theoriae musicae,\" hoping to eventually integrate music theory as part of mathematics. This part of his work, however did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians.\nWorks.\nThe works which Euler published separately are:", "score": 0.6829758644777927, "question": null, "meta": {"name": "Contributions of Leonhard Euler to mathematics", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7079444", "vector_id": "1183543"}, "embedding": null, "id": "9493facc9dbd9488750dece274fddca2"}, {"text": "Theophile Ernest de Donder [1872 \u2013 1957] was a Belgian thermodynamicist, mathematician, and physicist famous for his 1923 work in developing correlations between the Newtonian concept of chemical affinity and the Gibbsian concept of free energy.
