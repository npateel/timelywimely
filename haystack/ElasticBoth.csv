History.
Design and production.
The ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" poster was designed by the Ministry of Information",Keep Calm and Carry On,45.588235294117645,"British stoicism: the ""stiff upper lip"", self-discipline, fortitude and remaining calm in adversity. Susannah Walker comments that it is now seen ""not only as a distillation of a crucial moment in Britishness, but also as an inspiring message from the past to the present in a time of crisis"". She goes on to point out, however, that such an interpretation overlooks the circumstances of its production, and the relative failure of the campaign of which it formed a part.
Trademark claims.
In August 2011, it was reported that a UK-based company called Keep Calm and Carry On Ltd (managed by entrepreneur Mark Coop) had registered the slogan as a community trade mark in the EU, CTM No: 009455619, and in the United States, No. 4066622, after failing to obtain its registration as a trademark in the United Kingdom",Keep Calm and Carry On,69.73995271867611

Background.
Beer halls are huge taverns that existed in most larger southern German cities, where hundreds or even thousands of people are able to gather during the evenings, drink beer out of large stoneware jugs (steins) and often engage in political or social debate. They are also places where political rallies can be held, a tradition still alive today.

3698,what happens when iron reacts with oxygen and water,['Rust'],Rust,"corrosion products are dictated by the availability of water and oxygen. With limited dissolved oxygen, iron(II)-containing materials are favoured, including FeO and black lodestone (Fe3O4). High oxygen concentrations favour ferric materials with the nominal formulae Fe(OH)3-xOx/2. The nature of rust changes with time, reflecting the slow rates of the reactions of solids. Furthermore, these complex processes are affected by the presence of other ions, such as Ca2+, which both serve as an electrolyte, and thus accelerate rust formation, or combine with the hydroxides and oxides of iron to precipitate a variety of Ca-Fe-O-OH species.

Trivia.
In the film, Tala asks the sheriff what happened to the previous sheriff. The sheriff replies that the previous sheriff died in a mysterious car accident. This is a reference to how the real Buford Pusser died.
In the original film, Pusser uses a wooden stick to beat the criminals. Director Kevin Bray wanted to update it by making it a baseball bat. But there were objections, so the compromise was to just add a handle.
Reception.
The reviews from the critics were mostly negative. According to Rotten Tomatoes, 24% of the reviews (31 out of 128) were positive.
The film grossed $114 million worldwide. The budget of the film was $46 million.
